# Loan_status_prediction

In this project of loan status prediction, we have build a machine learning model which will predict whether a user is eligible for a personal loan or not by taking input of few parameters which are :

1.Loan_ID	
2.Gender
3.Married
4.Dependents	
4.Education	
5.Self_Employed	
6.ApplicantIncome	
7.CoapplicantIncome	
8.LoanAmount	(in dollars)
9.Loan_Amount_Term	(in months)
10.Credit_History	
11.Property_Area	

Then model will predict whether user is eligible or not through loan_status attribute

Here, we have taken 4 ML models in which Logistic Regression model performs best on unseen data . So, we have use that model .
